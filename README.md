# Smart-Blind-Stick
Blind peoples have to face many challenges in their life, one of them is finding their way on the streets. On the streets, there are so many vehicles and obstacles that may block their way and also may injure them.So keeping this problem in the mind we developed a Smart blind stick that scans for the obstacles in front of it with the help of an ultrasonic sensor.

#Working of Smart-Blind-Stick

- The Smart Blind Stick scans the path in front of it with the help of an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor.
- Whenever the sensor detects any object in its path the buzzer starts beeping and also at the same time the LED turns on.
- The blind person can hear the beeping of the buzzer and manage to change the way. In this way, the person can easily find his way without getting injured.
- This smart stick works in the same way as the Ultrasonic range finder did. You can also see the real-time values of the distance in cm on the Arduino serial monitor.
